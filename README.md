# gloss-modeling
Implementation of the [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com) book examples in Haskell using Gloss to implement the graphics.

## Usage

We recommend using [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org) to manage the package dependencies. To compile the whole project:

`stack build`

Call each example executable code through stack as well:

`stack exec <code>`
